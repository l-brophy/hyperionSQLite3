# e-Bookstore: SQLite3 Capstone

## about the project

This was my submission for one of Hyperion's Level 2 capstones! The scope of the assignment was to create a terminal app, using Python and SQLite3, to allow a book store's staff to interact with their database through various predetermined prompts.

## utility

The program makes use of standard CRUD operations to automate interactions with the database - rather than expect the store's staff to learn SQL to manage their database, or hire somebody who does and risk errors of communication, the program allows them to do everything that they need to do to manage the database - just by following prompts in the Terminal! 

## installation

To make use of this program, you must have Python 3 installed on your system, and the [tabulate module](https://pypi.org/project/tabulate/) in your Python install. 

If you wish to start the database with only your own books, do not download the `.txt` file in the repository. Otherwise, please ensure that you have downloaded both files in the same directory, or the program will not be able to read the file, and you'll have to start from scratch! 

Once you are ready to run the program, type the following code into your terminal according to your OS:

UNIX users: `$ python3 e_bookstore.py`

Windows users: `$ python e_bookstore.py`

If a prompt like this pops up, you're good to go! Enjoy!
