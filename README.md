# hyperionSQLite3

my submission for the databases capstone for hyperiondev's software engineering bootcamp, the assignment scope
was given as follows:

- conceptually: a terminal application that allows users to interact with a bookstore's digital database
- functionally: standard CRUD operations, but with python and sql syntax

I think this submission is a pretty good demonstration of getting better at not repeating myself - defined a lot of 
my own functions where I caught patterns and used them to both streamline the code and make it more readable
by making sure it wasn't muddied up by menu'ing prompts and such.
